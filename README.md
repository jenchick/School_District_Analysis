# School_District_Analysis
## Overview of the school district analysis
The school board has has concerns regarding the data in the students_complete.csv file such that evidence of academic dishonesty is present. They would like to remove the reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders, as they appear to have been altered. In order to uphold state-testing standards, I am to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs ("not a number") while keeping the rest of the data intact. Then, the original analysis should be completed to compare the new/revised results to the original results.
