# School_District_Analysis
## Overview of the school district analysis
The school board has has concerns regarding the data in the students_complete.csv file such that evidence of academic dishonesty is present. They would like to remove the reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders, as they appear to have been altered. In order to uphold state-testing standards, I am to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs ("not a number") while keeping the rest of the data intact. Then, the original analysis should be completed to compare the new/revised results to the original results.

## Results 
Upon completing the revised analysis where the reading and math grades for Thomas High School were removed (n = 461 students), the following was observed:

- The District Summary was not overly affected by the removal of the 461 students' grades.  The percent passing math and reading, along with the overall passing rate remained almost the same.

Replacing the ninth-grade scores affected the following:

  - Math and reading scores by grade seemed unaffected, such that the average math and reading scores remained the same.

  - Scores by school spending indicates that less money is spent per student when scores are higher.  Thomas High School falls into the range of $631 - $645 per student.
